Untrusted input in a command can lead to command injection,
allowing attackers to execute arbitrary commands and gain
control of the system. To prevent this:

1. Avoid direct command execution: Don't run OS commands
with user input directly.
2. Validate and sanitize input: Ensure input is safe by
removing or escaping dangerous characters.
3. (preferred) Use safe methods: Use `subprocess.run`
without `shell=True` to safely execute commands, as it
doesn't call a system shell by default. If `shell=True`
is necessary, properly quote and escape all input to prevent
shell injection. This is a secure by default approach.
